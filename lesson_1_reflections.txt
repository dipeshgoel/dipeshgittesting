How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It showes the changes that were made that could have caused issues.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It will allow a programmer to find content that could have been deleted.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Manually choosing allows for more specific commits, but also can make it inconsistent amongst the commits and various programmers.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Content in one file effects content in another file, so using Git vs Google Docs allows for files to be committed and compared together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows the log of commits.  git diff displays the changes from one change to another.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It makes the ability to fix problems much easier.
